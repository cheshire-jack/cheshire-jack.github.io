# Hi I'm Jack

My main interests  in no particular order are:
* Reverse Engineering
* Emulators
* Software Security
* Low level programming
* Malware
* Mobile applications
* Program Analysis

As you can see I have a lot of interests but they relate to each other nicely.  I hope that something on this blog will become useful to people.  It also allows me to keep track of my own progress and catalog some knowledge.  I also like to keep things light hearted and to have some fun.

Everything here is for educational use only.  I can't be responsible for any negative results you experienced by abusing the knowledge presented.  You shouldn't take anything I write too seriously.  In fact you shouldn't take it seriously at all.  What are you even doing here?  If you see any mistakes please let me know so that I can fix them.

If I have offended you in any way I apologize it's unintentional.  I don't really have opinions.
