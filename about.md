# Hi I'm Jack

Thanks for checking out my blog.   

My main interests are reverse engineering, vulnerability research, program analysis and mathematics.  I tend to focus on Linux but am interested in Windows and Android as well.    

You can find me on NetSecFocus Mattermost and Twitter.  Feel free to send any thoughts my way.
