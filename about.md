# Hi I'm Jack

My main interests  in no particular order are:
* Reverse Engineering
* Emulators
* Software Security
* Low level programming.
* Malware

I have a more serious project [Coded In 1nk](https://codedin1nk.github.io) that is dedicated to reverse engineering education.

The template for this site has come from [streetturtle](https://github.com/streetturtle/jekyll-clean-dark)
