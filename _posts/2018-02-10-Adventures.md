description:  Introduction to malware analysis project
---

This is the start of a new project for me.  I am very interested in malware.  How to detect it, how to analyze it, reverse engineer it, and how it does what it does.  (I'm using malware pretty broadly here to include many classes of software used for nefarious purposes.)

## 100 Files to analyze

Because there is an abundance of malware projects available in various places on the internet I have decided to just start picking them apart and learning everything I can from them.  I will begin with some of the more simplistic samples I can find and work up to more complicated samples from there.  

Why 100 files?  Because it seems like a good starting point and an achievable goal with everything else I have going on.  It also seems like I should be able to find 100 samples with source code without having to look too hard.  (I fully expect to encounter some that are of low quality and full of bad ideas.)

## The Goal

For any project I like to have a set of goals I'm working towards.  In this case I have three goals.  
* First I want to gain a much deeper understanding of the code that goes into malware.  I'm a very visual learner so seeing the code and dissecting it helps me a lot.
* Second I want to develop my static analysis and reverse engineering skills.  By dissecting these files and then digging into the assembly I can gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between the two.
* Third I want to start developing my own methodology for malware analysis.  Experiment with developing custom tools, frameworks, lab environments, etc.  This is a good way to get that going.
